# Summer 2015 Mobile Development

Hello everyone! I'm excited to get started with class and I hope you are too. Over the next 12 weeks we will cover Objective-C, Swift, the iOS SDK, and a bunch of other concepts too numerous to name. We will also tackle problems and challenges that software engineers face everyday around the world. This is all to get you to begin to think like an engineer. It will be difficult, but I hope also a lot of fun. By the end of this course you all should be able to build iOS applications for both yourself and your future clients/employers. I encourage you all to push towards releasing at least 1 app in the App Store. There really is nothing more satisfying than having an app that is publicly available and something you can point to as an execution of your vision and hard work.

As you can tell by reading this, we will use Github for all assignments, notes, and any other info that needs to be shared with the whole class. As a first step, please star this repository. It will create a bookmark in your account and also allow me to see who's following the repository so I can allow you access.

You will notice a homework directory in this repository. This is where all homework assignments will be posted. Some will be actual Xcode projects while others will be just some source code and/or tips/hints used to solve the problem at hand. Homework 00 is the first assignment and it will be due at midnight June 14th, the night before our class starts. Please be sure to get HW 00 done before class. It will allow us to get right to building apps!

Feel free to reach out to me on Slack (what's that?) once the class starts with any questions you may have. You will also use Slack to converse and get help from your classmates. Don't worry, we'll get all that set up on the first day of class.

Welcome to the first step of many on the road to becoming a full fledged software engineer!
